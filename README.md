Artemis Financial is a group that develops and provide financial consulting advice to customers. They are looking to modernize their systems with a focus on software security. I think this project gave me an opportunity to look in more detail at the code base and understand vulnerabilities. Secure code is essential to determining that your program will function correctly and not be open to attacks upon release. For future employers I think I would show them the code base that was given to me and the work I did within it, as a testament that I understand the code operations happening in the base files.
